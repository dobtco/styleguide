DOBT's coding styleguides
===

Until Hound supports organization-wide config (https://github.com/houndci/hound/issues/576, https://github.com/houndci/hound/issues/996), these files will need to be manually copied to the projects that need them.


To copy these files to a different repository, run this command in the other repository's directory:

```
cp ~/src/styleguide/{.hound.yml,.rubocop.yml,.scss-lint.yml} ./
```
